### A Brief Bio 👋

I have always felt a pull to be analytical and creative. Whether selling paint, working in retail, landscaping, or trying to start a digital magazine, I was always looking for ways to create new products and improve systems. One day, while working with data from Google Analytics, I decided to give Python a try. Immediately, I fell in love with coding and analytics.

Now, I am finishing up a Data Analytics certificate through the University of Denver. Concepts that once sounded like a monologue from Star Trek: TNG’s “Data” now seem simple. I have a lot more to learn and am looking forward to growing in my career and knowledge as a budding data analyst.
