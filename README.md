### üëã Hi, I'm Cole Comstock. Here's a little about me... 

I am analytical and creative. I am always looking for ways to create new products and improve systems. While working with data from Google Analytics, I decided to try Python, and I immediately fell in love with coding and analytics.

Currently, I work as a Web Content Specialist / Web Anlayst with Colorado Christian Univerisity. I am completing a Data Analytics certificate through the University of Denver. Concepts that once sounded like a monologue from Star Trek: TNG‚Äôs ‚ÄúData‚Äù now seem simple. While I have more to learn, I look forward to growing in my career and knowledge as a data analyst.
